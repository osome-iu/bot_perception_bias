## Variables of Interest
### Estimated Bot Prevalence

`Post_TPEself`: Perceived influence of bots on selves in the posttest.

`Post_TPEother`: Perceived influence of bots on others in the posttest.  

### Perceived self ability to recognize bots (i.e., self-efficicacy)
`Pre_eff_ave`: Perceived self-efficacy of recognizing bots in the pretest.  
`Post_eff_ave`: Perceived self-efficacy of recognizing bots in the posttest.  

### Policy Preferences

`Post_rstc`: Preference of level of restrictions about bots in the posttest.  
`reg_cpn`: Ranked preference of "regulation against social media companies" as the countermeasure against bot manipulation.
